# Integrating with Cypress Component Testing

Cypress ships official support for many popular libraries and frameworks, such as [React](/guides/component-testing/react/overview) and [Angular](/guides/component-testing/angular/overview). We constantly monitor what libraries developers are favoring and are always exploring adding new ones to Cypress.

All officially supported libraries feature a first class onboarding experience, where we detect and scaffold the correct files, and a framework-specific `mount` adapter, to render your components. We call this collection of features a *Framework Definition*, since it defines the requirements for a library or framework to work in Cypress.

If your favorite library isn't featured, don't worry - we expose the same API we use internally for third parties to define their own Framework Definitions.

In this guide, you'll learn how to author a Framework Definition, which will enjoy the same polished onboarding experience as our officially supported frameworks.

## Concepts

There are two requirements for authoring a Framework Definition.

1. Definition File (we recommending naming this `definition.cjs`)
2. Mount adapter (we recommending naming this `index.mjs`)

The Definition is required when users configure Component Testing for the first time. The Mount adapter is used to render components when writing tests.

## Framework Definition

Below is a minimal Framework Definition. Note that `defineFrameworkDefinition` is purely for type safety, similar to `defineConfig` in `cypress.config`.

There is one important convention; the `type` key in `defineFrameworkDefinition` should match the name of your package on npm, and should be named `cypress-ct-*` or `@organization/cypress-ct-*`. Some examples of valid names include:

- `cypress-ct-react-js`
- `cypress-ct-svelte-testing`
- `@cypress/cypress-ct-react`
- `@angular/cypress-ct-angular`

Cypress will look at `node_modules` when it starts up, and load all the Framework Definitions found based on this naming convention.

A simple example of a Framework Defintion for the [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) library might look like this:

```js
const { defineFrameworkDefinition } = require("cypress");

/**
 * The minimum version of the library this Framework Definition supports.
 * @type {Cypress.CypressComponentDependency}
 */
const solidDep = {
  // Unique, semantic identifier.
  type: "solid-js",

  // Human readable name.
  name: "Solid",

  // Package name install from `npm`.
  package: "solid-js",

  /**
   * Similar to package, but can include a version or tag.
   * Used during setup to generate an install command for users.
   * Eg: `solid-js@next`
   */
  installer: "solid-js",

  // Human readable description.
  description:
    "A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.",

  // Minimum supported version.
  minVersion: "^1.6.0",
};

/**
 * Similar to above. Create an smooth, seamless setup experience
 * by ensuring the user has all the necessary dependencies.
 * @type {Cypress.CypressComponentDependency}
 */
const solidVitePlugin = {
  type: "solid-js-vite-plugin",
  name: "Vite Plugin Solid",
  package: "vite-plugin-solid",
  installer: "vite-plugin-solid",
  description: "A simple integration to run solid-js with vite",
  minVersion: "^1.6.0 || ^2.0.0",
};

/**
 * The actual definition.
 */
module.exports = defineFrameworkDefinition({
  /**
   * This should match the `npm` package name.
   * The convention required to ensure your Definition is processed
   * by Cypress is `cypress-ct-*` for global packages, or
   * `@org/cypress-ct-*` for organization level packages.
   */
  type: "@lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js",

  /**
   * The category. Only "library" is supported right now.
   * "library" refers to a JavaScript library that runs in the browser,
   * without requiring an obfuscated configuration file,
   * such as Create React App or Next.js

   * injecting a custom dev server configuration will be supported.

Our Framework Definition shows up in Cypress!

<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/component-testing/framework-definition-1.png"
  alt="custom framework definition"
/>

We defined the `dependencies`, which are also correctly handled - we haven't installed them all, so Cypress is prompting us to do so:


<DocsImage
  src="/img/guides/component-testing/framework-definition-2.png"
  alt="required dependencies"
/>

## Mount Adapter

The second part of defining a Framework Definition is the Mount Adapter. This is the function that renders the component in your tests using `cy.mount()`. 

By default, Cypress will look for this as a `mount` function that is a **named export** from the package. This should be written in a `index.mjs` file. This example is for a [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) mount adapter:

```js
import { getContainerEl, setupHooks } from "@cypress/mount-utils";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";

let dispose;

function cleanup() {
  dispose?.();
}

/**
 * @param {() => JSX.Element} - component to render
 */
export function mount(component, options = {}) {
  const root = getContainerEl();
  dispose = render(() => component, root);

  return cy.wait(0, { log: false }).then(() => {
    if (options.log) {
      Cypress.log({
        name: "mount",
        message: "Mounted component",
      });
    }
  });
}

// Cleanup after each test
setupHooks(cleanup);
```

This is different for each library.

## package.json

The final thing you need is a correctly configured `package.json`. This example was created using [our official template](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-ct-definition-template).

The main thing to notice is the `exports` property. The `node` entry points to the Framework Definition, and the `default` entry points to the Mount Adapter:

```json {5-8}
{
  "name": "@lmiller1990/cypress-ct-solid-js",
  "version": "0.0.4",
  "description": "Example mounting adapter for Cypress and Solid.js",
  "exports": {
    "node": "./definition.cjs",
    "default": "./index.mjs"
  },
  "files": [
    "package.json",
    "definition.cjs",
    "index.mjs"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "@cypress/mount-utils": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "solid-js": "^1.6.0"
